# CppTutorialWithExamples
This is my personal C++ tutorial, there are a lot of examples, then I also made executables of all the programs so you can try to run them with with ./(file name) these were compiled with g++.

You can download the C++ files and executables by going into your linux terminal emulator and writing:
git clone https://github.com/CollinEdward/CppTutorialWithExamples.git
cd CppTutorialWithExamples
ls

And there you will see the files and executables, you can also open the files in a fx Visual Studio Code or other code viewing applications.
